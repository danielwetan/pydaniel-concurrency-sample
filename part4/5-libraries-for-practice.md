In this video, we are going to take a look at
- Other standard libraries
- Python drawbacks
- Libraries for data analysis

# Standard Python libraries
- Concurrent.futures - Launching parallel tasks
- Asyncio - Asynchronous I/O, Tasks

# We can achieve parallelism in two ways
- Multithreading has GIL syndrome
- Multiprocessing has memory usage, communication overheads

# Data analysis in Python
- Numpy and pandas
- Overcome GIL
- Newer libraries like Numba and PythonAccelerator
