In this section, we are going to take a look at
- Advanced OSes and programming environments
- Concurrency versus parallelism
- Libraries in python, used to achieve concurrency and parallelism
- Operating System's building blocks of parallel execution
- Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

# Advanced OSes and programming environments
- Evaluation of computing hardware
- Advancement of OSes to support concurrency
- Programmers' interface to concurrency

Moore's Law
The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately two years.
The meaning of this is that processing power of a computer would double every two years.

Dual-Core Processor
Each core is capable of executing instructions simultaneously without interfering or depending on the other cores.
This meant that multiple tasks could run at the same time and processors concurrently, and that if only one task is run then the remaining cores would be idle.

Operating System
- Process and thread
- Process scheduling
- Virtual memory
- Inter-process communication
- Process synchronization

OS interface
- Libraries of supervisor calls
- Special (syntactically distinct) language constructs
- Subroutine libraries in programming languages
